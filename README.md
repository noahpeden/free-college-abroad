# Free Degree Finder

This project template was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project was inspired by learning about how there are more than a dozen countries out there that offer completely free college tuition for undergraduate degrees and how many of those classes are in English. This site was built in React Redux with a backend set up in Rails.  Based on user input, the site grabs what university options are out there and lists some basic information, along with a link to the university.

At this point, the only big thing that's missing is a little bit of research into the countries to see which universities offer what.
